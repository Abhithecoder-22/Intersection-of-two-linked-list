# Contributor Guidelines

- Add projects on with proper filenames
- In case folders are not available for a particular language or tech stack, then contributors are requested to add a folder and then contribute.
For example: A contributor wants to add solutions in `c#` and a folder for the same is not present then in such case the file path would be `DSA/C#/Project Name`
In general: `DSA/Programming Language/Project Name`
- In General: `Folder/Sub Folder/Project Folder/ Project Files`
